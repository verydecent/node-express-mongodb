Practicing CRUD with Mongodb persistence

This was an intersting tutorial because I was dealing with code that was deprecated from the latest version of MongoDB. So I was googling for a long time trying to search the error codes returned from the terminal and after a while I realized the coding syntax had been deprecated. This was very intersting as it was the first time I've coded using old code material. So I simply downgraded to a younger version of the code and the code worked.

Also I used the npm package MongoUI which allowed me to check the status of my db. After using curl I could visually check if my database collection had persisted and if data had been properly manipulated using Curl.

I really enjoy MongoDB thus far, but I will have to dig deeper into it since I implemented very simple CRUD operations.

This was my first time using a NoSQL database.

step 1
start mongod
step 2
start node
step 3
test endpoints using curl
step 4
use mongoui to check on status of persisted data
